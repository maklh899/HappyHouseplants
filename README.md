## Setup
- Make a fork of ChicoState/HappyHouseplants

- Create two .env files with the values below
    - note: 
        - .env files should not be committed to GitHub
        - Secret values have been changed to serve as an example
        - DB_USER is a secret
        - DB_PASSWORD is a secret
        - EXPO_HOSTNAME is the hostname, or IP address, of the machine that is running the backend

`/backend/.env`
```
CONNECT_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/
CONTAINER_URL=mongodb://happyplant-db:27017/
DB_NAME=happyplants
DB_USER=SOMEUSER
DB_PASSWORD=SOMEPASSWORD
```
`/frontend/.env`
```
EXPO_HOSTNAME=SOMEHOSTNAME/IP*
```
*We recommend using the local IP address of the machine running the Docker application.

### To run a local instance of the database and API:
- Change directory to HappyHousePlants repository

`cd HappyHousePlants`

- Run one of the commands below:
    
    ```
    ./start.sh
    ```
    
    OR
    ```
    cd backend && docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d && cd ../frontend && npm install && expo start
    ```
    
    OR
    ```
    npm install
    cd backend && docker-compose build
    docker-compose up -d
    cd ../frontend && npm install
    expo start
    ```
